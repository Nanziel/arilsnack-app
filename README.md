## 📋 Project Overview

This application modernizes the dine-in experience by replacing traditional paper menus. It allows customers to identify themselves, select their table number, browse the complete menu digitally, add special instructions to their orders, and review their cart before finalizing the purchase.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Digitize Operations:** Move away from manual order taking.
* **Enhance Accuracy:** Reduce errors by allowing customers to input specific notes directly.
